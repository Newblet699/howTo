<h5 id="beginner tricks to teach your dog">Beginner tricks.</h5>
<ol>
    <li>"Sit" is a good and easy trick to teach your dog early.</li>
    <li>"Paw" is a neat trick and a cute way for your dog to do.</li>
    <li>"Bark, Speak, Please, etc" is another easy trick to teach your dog.</li>
    <li>"Fetch" is necessary for hunting dogs if you have one so that they can fetch you rodents or if you don't have a hunting dog then your dog can fetch the ball or stick.</li>
    <li>"Wait" should also be taught to any dog as this is used to tell the dog to stay in one place while you are doing something.</li>
</ol>

<p1>My two doggos are Riley and Rufus. They both love to do tricks, play in the sand and need to move around alot. Both dogs need alot of attention, play time, space and love as they are also living and feeling beings. Riley needs daily exercise and daily training to keep her agile and fresh. She also needs to be held alot and loves to lay on your lap. Rufus also has daily exercise and daily training but is a more relaxed dog than riley is. He loves to just lay near you and always loves to play with a ball or pipe. He absolutely loves head pats and licks anything and everything he can.(This is just an example of how two dogs are different in their day to day life.)</p1>

<p2>Note: Not all dogs learn at the same speed. Your dog might be a quick learner or a slow learner. Not all of these tricks are a 100% guarentee that your dog will learn easily. These tricks are only the most common ones to do. Also if you do not have enough time in your schedule then try to allocate the steps to times that will fit your schedule. And another key thing is to give your dog alot of encouragement and treats if they do the trick right or even semi right. This will show them that doing that specific thing will result in a yummy treat for them and they will keep doing and eventually remember the trick. Have a good day and good luck with your dog!</p2>
